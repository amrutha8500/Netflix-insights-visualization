# Comprehensive Analysis & Visualization of Netflix Content: A Machine Learning Approach

Delve deep into Netflix's expansive content library, merging the intricate visualizations of Tableau with the predictive power of RapidMiner.

## Overview

Netflix's expansive library has shaped entertainment across the globe. By harnessing the power of Tableau for detailed visualizations and RapidMiner for intricate data analysis and machine learning, this project presents an in-depth perspective of content trends, user preferences, and predictive analytics.

## Visualization Dashboards

The heart of this project lies in its visual representation of key data points. The Tableau workbook encapsulates:

- **Global Content Distribution**: Map out the expanse of Netflix content across continents and countries.
- **Content Type Analysis**: Dive into the diverse range of content - from movies to TV shows, and understand their reception through ratings.
- **Yearly Content Release**: Track the growth trajectory of Netflix's offerings, year by year.
- **Genre Analysis**: From thrillers to rom-coms, gauge the variety and volume of genres in the Netflix library.

## Predictive Analytics

Using RapidMiner, the project takes a deep dive into the realm of machine learning:

- **Random Forest Model**: Predict the next blockbuster or hit series using attributes such as content type, director, and star cast.
- **Decision Tree Model**: Decode the determinants of content ratings and viewer preferences.
- **Regression Techniques**: Estimate content lengths with variables like genre and director as predictors.

Each model has been meticulously trained and cross-validated to enhance its prediction accuracy.

## Getting Started

1. **Setup**: Clone this repository to your workstation.
2. **Visualization**: Launch Tableau and open the `.twbx` file to immerse yourself in the dashboards.
3. **Data Mining**: Use RapidMiner to delve into the `.rmp` files and unravel machine learning models and analyses.
